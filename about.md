I'm a data scientist and a software engineer. 

Typically, data scientists rely on software engineers to create applications or systems for them so they can start doing data science. I'm self-reliant, which means I collaborate effectively with the tech team to build and deploy data applications in production.

My educational background is in theoretical and computational physics.

I appreciate your visit. Have a great day! :)
