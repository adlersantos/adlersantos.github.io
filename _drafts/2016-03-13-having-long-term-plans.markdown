Twelve years ago, I was in my sophomore year in college and I set out on a path that forever changed my life: I decided to shift my concentration from political science to physics. I've envisioned myself to have a life of learning and curiousity about the universe and our world, whether it be as a scientist or as an engineer. This was a deliberate strategy.

After getting my masters degree in Physics and spending a year working in the Manila Observatory, the next obvious step that I did was to apply for a PhD in Cosmology somewhere in the UK. This path was soon diverted due to the emerging need to be financially stable, academic bureaucracies (and sad to say, the often-foretold poverty that goes with it), and my love affair with computers. Now, I'm making a living as a data scientist "slash" software engineer, and I've never been happier with my career.

In his book [Zero To One](http://zerotoonebook.com/), Peter Thiel writes that we should think very hard and consider if what we want to do will be valuable in the future. It's often said that "If you love what you do and you're good at it, keep doing it and success will follow." He completely disagrees with the statement. I also do too. We must be very cautious in choosing what we want to do, and be vigilant for way better opportunities that emerge as we set on our deliberate plans in life.

I was already a few months into finishing sophomore year when I made my decision to pursue physics. Some friends thought this was ridiculous and that they felt sorry for me to be in college that long. But I had something that these people didn't have at that time: foresight.

I cared more on the future value of having a physics background, which equipped me with analytical thinking and strong problem solving skills. This is in contrast to having a political science background, which involves a lot of handwaving, endless discussions stemming from the fact that there are no exact answers, whoever gives the most appealling speech gets the most praise, and so on.

Foresight helped me predict that the need for analytical thinking in the technology industry will exponentially grow in value in the future. There's just so much yet to be discovered and invented for science and technology! In Zero To One terms, so much secrets to be found. I was fortunate enough that how I envisioned my life (to always be learning and curious about the universe and our world) aligns with what is, and will be, valued.

Clayton Christensen talks about using theories to serve as your life guides. He writes about this in his book "How Will You Measure Your Life?" The strength that theories have is that they don't tell you _what_ to do. Instead, theories teach you _how_ to think about things. It helps you frame a problem or situation (or life in general) in a way that lets you methodically find your most optimal options moving forward.

Theories also don't operate on hindsight. If you tell someone exactly what to do based on your own experience, it may not really turn out well for them. This is because what applies to your own unique situations and experiences almost always don't generalize well to the situations of others. But if you tell someone how to think about their situation, i.e. by giving them a theory, then you've given them a mindset on how to find a solution unique only to their situation.

So why the hell am I talking about theories for anyway? My theory in life is to always be learning and curious about the universe and our world. This "guiding light" has worked really well for me. Just as theory goes hand-in-hand with experiment, I've spent years polishing this theory of mine to work well in my life's practical matters.

This theory won't really work if even at the most basic level, things already break down. For example, not having the capacity to put food on the table for you and the people who rely on you. It doesn't really make sense to starve myself and my loved ones just so I can keep on learning about the world. Having a theory and going through life with it in a linear fashion is never gonna happen. It's also balancing act.

If I were to still hold my theory true in life and at the same time put food on the table, where do I fit? I don't think academia fits well for the former, but not the latter. There must be some rewarding role in the tech industry where the top performers are those who have a background in physics and know how to code. Data science is exactly what I was looking for.

My circumstance was a mix of both the booming technology industry and the need for logically minded problem solvers. It's been twelve years, but I don't think I will ever change the _fundamental nature_ of how I go about with my life: always curious, always learning, always rational, but polite. The long-term plan that I've set for myself more than a decade ago is finally starting to pay off. This is redemption for the long-term.

The idea of having long-term goals isn't really new. But everyone doesn't really do it, or tries to find a faster way out, for fear of having invested too much time on something that never really pays off.

But things that don't pay off are those that have less value in the future. This is why it's worth repeating how important foresight is in choosing what we want to do.

How can I be so confident to say that the demand for logical thinking and technical skills will keep on growing in the future? Well, 1 > 0 will always be true, even a billion years from now. You can deduce the rest.

My free time is usually spent with friends and family, or by learning something new about technology (specifically data science) or about the universe through technical resources (nice to meet you, gravitational waves!).

Not 1-2 year goals, 6-10 year goals! Design your "self".

What about randomness? People would claim the inevabCircumstance is about maximizing returns on good days and surviving the bad days.

Handling randomness is about diversifying the ways in which you can get to your destination. If there's one and only one way to get to where you wanna be, your chances of getting there will be slim due to random factors. Even a single diversion will be a cause for failure.

But if you've prepared for unexpected, chance diversions, then you will diversify your approach.

What are examples of good days? The short decision time you're given to accept or reject a work offer. Maximize by negotiating. The moment will only come again in years, after you decide to move on and look for another job.

What are examples of bad days?

> Failure is a few errors in judgement.

Just because disaster doesn't strike at the start doesn't mean it won't.

Things that are done for the long-term have the biggest rewards.

"Well I drank a lot and smoked a lot for weeks, and I didn't get ill."
"Well I didn't learn any new skill in 6 months and I still have my job."

These are exactly the kinds of error in judgement that deludes us every damn day. My painfully honest answer is "Well we gotta be smarter than that!" What happens when disaster strikes? When we lose our jobs, when we have kidney or lung failures?"

I started to consciously catch myself make errors in judgement, and started preventing them. If you don't stop doing this, then you'll never come to a point when you'll say "I was doing so well 10 years ago". You will always do well and do better.

We gotta survive the bad days.

If you can't catch the simple errors, then how can you recognize and avoid the more complicated ones?

Insurance on things that you can't afford to replace.

In the long term, the future will always be better than the present. This is a fact.
