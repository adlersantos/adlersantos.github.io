      <h1>On Change vs. Being Who You Are</h1>
<p class="subtitle">August 20, 2017</p>

<p>One of the things I’ve more understood lately was the concept of adapting how I behave to the context I was in. I’m aware that I’ve been doing this, but I was also constantly questioning it.</p>

<p>I’ve been wondering if I might be betraying myself, or perhaps this is psychologically unhealthy in the long term, to act against my familiar behavioural inclinations. <!--more--></p>

<p>Then I came upon questioning the assumption that behaviour is always associated to who we truly are. And it turns out not to be true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Changing how you behave doesn’t mean changing who you are.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some of the notable differences in my behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The gentle, sweet, nerdy person at home</li>
  <li>The perpetual learner who always strives for excellence at work</li>
  <li>The happy, confident guy in malls, cafes, and restos</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Step out of your bubble once in a while, for your own good and self-improvement.</p>
