One of the things I've more understood lately was the concept of adapting how I behave to the context I was in. I'm aware that I've been doing this, but I was also constantly questioning it.

I've been wondering if I might be betraying myself, or perhaps this is psychologically unhealthy in the long term, to act against my familiar behavioural inclinations.

Then I came upon questioning the assumption that behaviour is always associated to who we truly are. And it turns out not to be true.

> Changing how you behave doesnâ€™t mean changing who you are.

Some of the notable differences in my behaviour:

- The gentle/sweet/nerdy person when at home
- The leader or engineer who always strives for excellence when at work
- The happy, confident guy in malls, cafes, and restos

Step out of your bubble once in a while, for your own good and self-improvement.
